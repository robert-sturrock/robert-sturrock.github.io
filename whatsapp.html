            <p> <a href="https://robertms.shinyapps.io/whatsapp_analytics_tool/">Skip straight to the app</a>  </p>

            <p> I got the idea for this project during the second year of my masters degree. Two of my close friends - Debbie and Liam - and I had a very active WhatsApp conversation, one that I thought would cover most of my experiences at Oxford. At one point I downloaded the message thread to check the number of words and came up with something around 110,000. We'd basically written a short novel through our phones. </p>

            <p>But other than scrolling through it there wasn't an easy way for me to pick out what we'd talked about or find a particular conversation. So I built something to do it.  </p>

            <p> The web app I built makes use of Rstudio's Shiny package, ggplot, and the visNetwork package. Once you upload a conversation it will show you a number of things. The first is a conversation network - essentially who messaged and who responded - for the entire conversation. </p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid img-border " src="img/network.jpg" alt="network">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Node size is proportional to # of messages sent. Lines (and thickness) indicate number of messages between two participants. </span>


            <p>On the second tab it shows word frequency and share of the conversation. I also added in a feature so you can smooth over a number of days.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid img-border " src="img/number-messages.jpg" alt="talking">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">30-day moving average of number of messages sent to the group per day. Debbie is a star contributor. </span>

            <p> On the final tab you can search for particular bits of the conversation. Say I wanted to see when we'd talked about breakups. I could search "breakup" and see when the word was mentioned.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid img-border " src="img/breakup1.jpg" alt="talking">
            </a>


            <p> Then once I've found the mentions I can enter a particular line number and click over to the "context" tab and see messages either side of the particular mention.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid img-border " src="img/breakup2.jpg" alt="talking">
            </a>

            <p> Want to play around? It works with any iPhone based WhatsApp conversation (you can download one in txt form directly from the WhatsApp app).  </p>
